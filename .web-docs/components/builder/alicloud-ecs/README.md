  region. By default, Packer will keep the encryption setting to what it
  was in the source image.

- `image_force_delete` (bool) - If this value is true, when the target image names including those
  copied are duplicated with existing images, it will delete the existing
  images and then create the target images, otherwise, the creation will

  source snapshots of those images will be delete either. If
  [-force](/packer/docs/commands/build#force) option is provided in `build`
  command, this option can be omitted and taken as true.

- `image_force_delete_instances` (bool) - Alicloud Image Force Delete Instances

- `image_ignore_data_disks` (bool) - If this value is true, the image created will not include any snapshot
  of data disks. This option would be useful for any circumstance that

  snapshots.

- `tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`tags`](#tags) but defined as a singular repeatable block

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `temporary_key_pair_type` (string) - `dsa` | `ecdsa` | `ed25519` | `rsa` ( the default )
  
  Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are 'dsa',
  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.
  
  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure, please
  consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.

- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the
  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072
  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as
  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length
  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521
  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for
  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be
  ignored.
  
  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure as specified
  by FIPS 186-5, please consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->


- `ssh_keypair_name` (string) - If specified, this is the key that will be used for SSH with the
  machine. The key must match a key pair name loaded up into the remote.
  By default, this is blank, and Packer will generate a temporary keypair
  unless [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) is used.
  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) or
  [`ssh_agent_auth`](#ssh_agent_auth) must be specified when
  [`ssh_keypair_name`](#ssh_keypair_name) is utilized.


- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory
  of current user.


- `ssh_agent_auth` (bool) - If true, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate connections to
  the source instance. No temporary keypair will be created, and the
  values of [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) and
  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) will be ignored. The
  environment variable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` must be set for this option to work
  properly.


### Alicloud RAM permission

Finally the plugin should gain a set of Alicloud RAM permission to call Alicloud API.

The following policy document provides the minimal set permissions necessary for the Alicloud plugin to work:

~> Note: Images can become deprecated after a while; run
`aliyun ecs DescribeImages` to find one that exists.

~> Note: Since WinRM is closed by default in the system image. If you are
planning to use Windows as the base image, you need enable it by userdata in
order to connect to the instance, check
[alicloud_windows.json](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-alicloud/tree/main/builder/examples/basic/alicloud_windows.json)
and
[winrm_enable_userdata.ps1](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-alicloud/tree/main/builder/examples/basic/winrm_enable_userdata.ps1)
for details.

See the
[examples/alicloud](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-alicloud/tree/main/builder/examples)
folder in the Packer project for more examples.
