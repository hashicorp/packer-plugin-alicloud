- `oss_key_name` (string) - The name of the object key in `oss_bucket_name` where the RAW or VHD
  file will be copied to for import. This is treated as a [template
  engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine), and you may access any of the variables
  stored in the generated data using the [build](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine)
  template function.

- `skip_clean` (bool) - Whether we should skip removing the RAW or VHD file uploaded to OSS
  after the import process has completed. `true` means that we should
  leave it in the OSS bucket, `false` means to clean it out. Defaults to
  `false`.

- `image_system_size` (string) - Size of the system disk, in GB, values
   range:
    - cloud - 5 \~ 2000
    - cloud_efficiency - 20 \~ 2048
    - cloud_ssd - 20 \~ 2048
    - cloud_essd - 20 \~ 2048
